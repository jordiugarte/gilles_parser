	% Abstract
	\begin{abstract}
		This project involves designing and developing a compiler for the language Professor Gilles GEERAERTS implied for the instructions for this project. This language is called the Genial Imperative Language for Learning and the Enlightenment of Students (GILLES). Its grammar is stated in Table 1.\\ It is defined with reserved keywords, program names, variable names, and numerical constants specified through lexical rules. Program names start with uppercase letters, while variable names begin with lowercase letters, both being case-sensitive. Integral numerical constants consist solely of digits. GILLES supports two types of comments: short comments starting with the dollar sign (\$) and long comments enclosed by double exclamation marks (!!). These comments are ignored by the scanner and are not transmitted to the parser.

	\section{Background}
	According to **Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman (2007)** in *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools*, the process of compiling involves several critical stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and optimization before machine code is generated. These steps allow for the efficient translation of high-level language code into low-level machine instructions, ensuring that the compiled programs are fast and optimized for their specific runtime environment.
	
	This book is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" due to the dragon illustration on its cover and is a foundational text for anyone studying or working with compilers.
	
	\section{Objective}
		Assignment for Part 1: Produce a lexical analyzer of the compiler using JFlex.\\
