	This project involves designing and developing a compiler for the language called \textit{Genial Imperative Language for Learning and the Enlightenment of Students} (GILLES). Its grammar is stated under the Background section.\\
	This report focuses on the initial phase of compiler developmentâ€”the creation of a lexical analyzer using JFlex. The lexical analyzer is responsible for scanning GILLES source code, identifying lexical units, managing a symbol table, and handling errors. Through comprehensive testing with various GILLES programs, the lexical analyzer demonstrates robust tokenization and effective state transitions, laying a solid foundation for subsequent parts of the project.
